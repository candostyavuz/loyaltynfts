**Loyalty NFTs**

Use NFTs as an exciting bond between brands and consumers.
A solid and devoted group of consumers is a dream of every company.
Of course quality of the products, friendliness of customer service even the style, language the brand uses has immense effect on this belonging.
However, it is not all nor enough, especially when it comes to accessing to new loyal customers. Growing your community with new users and minimizing the leavers.
Rewarding is a key point for marketing at all times. All that loyalty cards, small, maybe worthless gifts sending postcards, now emails on important dates served for this crucial purpose.

But this has come to an end, especially for the younger generations. Nobody wants to carry loyalty cards anymore, receiving a bunch of emails does not make sense to anybody.

NFTs are great assets that can serve for this purpose. They are unique, transferrable, collectible, basically the asset of the new era. 

Imagine that products are sold with their conjugates, which are NFTs.
Lets say you buy a shoe from a well now brand and receive its NFT instantly, maybe even before you receive the product, if you bought it on the internet.
This NFT will have the basic information about the product and may include a small image or so. Depending of the product it can even be used for customizing the product and make it unique. 
Receiving an NFT is a pleasant activity for many people believe in block chain by itself. But of course this is not all.
Brands may use these NFTs to improve loyalty afterwards as a way of rewarding their customers.
Organizing lottery like attractions for NFT holders, random airdrops, sending gifts to the owner of certain products... For example buying a series of a certain product, hence collecting their NFTs may automatically trigger sending a free product.
Some companies may want to attract their customers to their own web pages. They can send the NFT if you buy the item directly from their site instead of another retailer like Amazon.
There are countless options that can be built on this idea and mechanism.
These NFT based rewarding activities will also trigger word of mouth, which is a key point for accessing new users.

What we get excited for most is the use of block chain to solve real life problems. This technology should not and cannot be limited to digital world. 
What we want to achieve is to adapt this technology to improve our lives, improve user experiences help solving real life problems in a cheaper and innovative way.
Use of NFTs for achieving loyalty is a very small subset of applications we have in mind.
Anti-counterfeiting, digital certification of products, supply chain security, trust in second hand goods are some of the other areas that we want to focus on soon.
We know that block chain will transform the world, transform in a very revolutionary way. It is in the very very beginning but has started and irreversible.
We are here to be a part of this revolution, we have courage, we have excitement, we are ready.
